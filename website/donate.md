# Donations and bounties

## Donate

You can donate on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gbdev) or on [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/gbdev). You can send a one-time donation of any amount or join the collective as backer, donating monthly.

::: tip WHY OPENCOLLECTIVE

The [gbdev](https://github.com/gbdev) organisation is an _informal_ collective of individuals. As such, we are not able to hold any fund in our accounts. Instead, the US based non-profit [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/) is our [fiscal host](https://thesocialchangeagency.org/blog/what-is-fiscal-hosting/), providing us the financial and legal infrastructure to receive donations and spend moneyf.

:::

It's also possible to donate specifically [towards a project](https://opencollective.com/gbdev/projects) under our umbrella. We'll do our best to honour this preference.

Donations are subject to a 10% fee from our Open Collective host (Open Source Collective) plus a variable fee from the payment processor (Wise).

Money collected on GitHub sponsors are paid out by GitHub to our Open Collective at the end of each month.

## What do we spend the money on?

We mostly use the money to:

-   Organize events (such as the gbcompo21) and give prizes,
-   Fund maintainers and contributors to our repositories,
-   Put bounties on issues on our repositories,
-   Donate back to some of the packages we use,
-   Pay servers and domains.

Expenses are tracked [here](https://opencollective.com/gbdev).

## Sponsoring

If you have a company and you are interested in being highlighted on some of our webpages and channels, we have sponsorship tiers starting at 50$/month. Get in touch at sponsors@gbdev.io to understand if this could be for you. We are interested in hearing how our software is helping your business etc.

Sponsorships are evaluated on a case-to-case basis and only be accepted if we feel like our core values are compatible and the relationship can last in the long term with beneficial effect for both parties.

## Bounties

Sometimes, we may assign a bounty to an Issue. Labels such as `bounty-25$`, `bounty-50$`, `bounty-100$` are used to specify the amount. If you wish to work on a issue with a bounty attached, it's a good measure to comment on the issue asking for it to be assigned to you\*.

If you send a Pull Request fixing that issue and this work gets merged, you will be able to claim this issue.

Payments are done via OpenCollective. You will receive an invitation to the GitHub email account shortly after the PR has been merged. If you wish to receive the invitation to another email address, please contact us.

You will be able to fill your details and how to receive the money (wire transfers and PayPal are supported\*\*). Details are generally verified in 24-48 hours. Payments are then processed by our Open Collective host a couple of times per week.

::: warning TAX CONSIDERATIONS

Make sure to check the tax rules of your country and properly declare the bounties received. We're not tax consultants and we cannot help with that.

:::

\* In case of inactivity we may remove the assignment to you or let someone else who submitted a PR claim the bounty.

\*\* Our Open Collective host uses Wise as the payment processor so the countries supported for the bank transfers depends on them.
