There are two ways to do this. One is to wait for the Drawing phase before waiting for HBlank. This effectively catches the very start of HBlank, leaving plenty of time to exit. Here&#39;s how the earlier example might look using this method:</p><div class="language-asm line-numbers-mode" data-ext="asm"><pre class="language-asm"><code>LYC::

This just barely works. There are only two cycles to spare! If there were multiple registers that needed updating, you might run into trouble. Normally, These really short HBlanks are the worst-case scenario that you always fear. However, in practice, HBlanks are normally much longer, often even longer than the drawing phase. Using this method, that can actually have unfortunate consequences:",-1),Je=v(`<p>This time, when all the processing was done, there was still plenty of time left in the scanline to safely exit. However, since HBlank was so long, the routine missed the check for the drawing window and wasted an entire scanline waiting for that Drawing -&gt; HBlank transition before it exited. Not only does this waste precious CPU time, but it also limits how often raster FX can be used throughout the frame. This method still works fine though, and can be an easy approach if you use Raster FX sparingly.</p><p>I&#39;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I usually like to strive for the absolute best method. In a perfect world, we would precisely know whether we have enough HBlank left to safely exit. There actually is a way to do that though! You just need to count exactly how long your routine takes, and make sure it always exits during HBlank. This comes with some caveats though. Most routines, if they haven&#39;t been specifically designed for this method, will take a variable amount of time. The main things you need to avoid are <code>if</code> statements and loops. Specifically, if statements of this form are problematic:</p><div class="language-asm line-numbers-mode" data-ext="asm"><pre class="language-asm"><code>    ; test a condition here...

If you need to use an if statement, always make it an if/else statement so that you can waste cycles in the <code>else</code> portion and take the same number of cycles.</p><p>So now that you&#39;re ready to count the cycles of your handler, how long do you need to make the routine?

That's because the first cycle of every instruction is used to fetch the operation code itself.

In this situation, the 2nd cycle of the VRAM-accessible time is in HBlank, so this won't actually cause any problems.",-1),tt=n("h2",{id:"but-wait",tabindex:"-1"},[n("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#but-wait","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),s(" But Wait!")],-1),nt=n("p",null,"The interrupt latency I showed earlier doesn't actually tell the full story.

With a 5-cycle offset due to a <code>call</code>, and the longest possible HBlank, the earliest HBlank might start is cycle 54, so that&#39;s the first attempt to read <code>STAT</code>. It keeps checking <code>STAT</code> until even in the worst-case scenario, it knows that HBlank will start. Then, it uses that time to write the scroll registers and exit. This way, it can still exit early, as long as the HBlank length permits. This routine takes 104 cycles in the worst-case scenario, but may take as few as 79 if HBlank comes sooner.</p><p>The reason that the double-busy-loop method requires checking for Mode 3 but this method does not is that the double-busy-loop method is not cycle-counted, so you might be at the very end of HBlank which is problematic. Since this method is cycle-counted, you know that if HBlank has begun, you are at or near the start of it.</p><p>If we make a similar list of pros and cons for this method, this is what it might look like:</p><h2 id="hybrid-cycle-counting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hybrid-cycle-counting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hybrid cycle-counting</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>may exit very early if HBlank is longer</li><li>allows enough time during blanking to write to up to three registers</li><li>never takes longer than one scanline</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>requires all code to be constant-time</li><li>requires tedious cycle-counting</li></ul><p>This method can work well in many circumstances, and is especially suited to frequent effects that modify multiple registers and need to exit quickly to avoid taking too much CPU time.
