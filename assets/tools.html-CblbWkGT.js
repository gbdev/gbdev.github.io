A popular platform is the Game Boy, both for its nostalgia and (relative) ease to program for.</p><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Warning</p><p>This document only applies to the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. Game Boy Advance programming has little in common with Game Boy programming.</p><p>If you want to program for the GBA, which is much more C-friendly (and C++ and Rust, for that matter) than the GB and GBC, then I advise you to download devkitARM and follow the <a href="https://gbadev.net/tonc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tonc</a> tutorial. Please note that the Game Boy Advance also functions as a Game Boy Color, so if you only have a GBA, you can use it for both GB and GBC development.</p></div><p>When someone wants to make their own game, one of the first problems they will encounter is picking the <em>tools</em> they will use. There current main options are:</p><ul><li>RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) and the Game Boy&#39;s Assembly language (ASM)</li><li>GBDK-2020 (Game Boy Development Kit) and the C language</li><li>ZGB (an engine built on GBDK-2020) and the C language</li><li>GB Studio (a drag-and-drop game creator with scripting)</li></ul><p>The purpose of this document is to provide some insights and help you make the better choice if you&#39;re starting a new project.

Given that an instruction takes approximately 2 to 3 cycles, this gives the CPU a capacity of 333,000~500,000 instructions per second. Its LCD boasts 60 fps [it&#39;s actually 59.73 fps], which rounds up to between 50,000 and 80,000 instructions per frame. Suddenly not so much, eh? It also has 8 kB of RAM, and 8 kB of video RAM ; a 160x144 px LCD (thus slightly wider than it&#39;s tall), 4 colors, and 4-channel audio.</p><p>The Super Game Boy adds a few minor things, such as a customizable screen border, and some crude color. It&#39;s also slightly faster than the DMG.</p><p>The Game Boy Color <em>can</em> [if you tell it to] unlock additional functionality, such as more fleshed-out color, a double-speed CPU, twice the video RAM and <em>four times</em> the RAM! (With caveats, obviously.)</p><h1 id="languages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#languages"><span>Languages</span></a></h1><p>The choice of programming language is important and can have a very large effect on a project. It determines how much work is involved, what will be possible, and how fast it will be able to run.</p><h3 id="assembly-asm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#assembly-asm"><span>Assembly (ASM)</span></a></h3><p>Most games and programs for the Game Boy written in ASM will use RGBDS or WLA-DX.</p><p>Strengths:</p><ul><li>Not too difficult to learn.</li><li>Extremely powerful and flexible.</li><li>When well written it allows for maximum speed and efficiency on the limited resources of the Game Boy hardware.</li></ul><p>Weaknesses:</p><ul><li>It takes a special kind of work to write optimized ASM code.</li><li>It&#39;s quite verbose and sometimes tedious.</li><li>Will require more time and learning to get up and running when compared with C.</li><li>Code may not be easily shared with ports of a game on other platforms.</li></ul><h3 id="c" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#c"><span>C</span></a></h3><p>C will typically be used with the SDCC compiler and GBDK-2020 or ZGB, though it can also be used on its own without a framework or with a different compiler/dev kit (such as <a href="https://github.com/z88dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">z88dk</a>).</p><p>Strengths:</p><ul><li>Allows for getting up and running faster than with ASM, especially when building on top of GBDK-2020 and ZGB.</li><li>The language abstractions make it relatively easy to implement ideas and algorithms.</li><li>C source debugging is available through Emulicious with the VSCode debug adapter, making it easier to understand problems if they arise.</li><li>ASM can be included in projects with C, either standalone or inline for speed critical features.</li></ul><p>Weaknesses:</p><ul><li>The SDCC C compiler won&#39;t always generate code that runs as fast as skilled, hand-optimized assembly. It has matured a lot in the 20 years since the original GBDK, but bugs still turns up on occasion. On a platform with a slow CPU such as the Game Boy this can be a factor.</li><li>It’s easier to write inefficient code in C without realizing it. The Game Boy&#39;s CPU is only capable of performing 8-bit addition or subtraction, or 16-bit addition. Using <code>INT32</code>s is quite taxing on the CPU (it needs to do two consecutive 16-bit adds, and add the carry). See the tips below to avoid such blunders.</li><li>There is overhead due to C being a stack-oriented language, whereas the Game Boy&#39;s CPU is rather built for a register-oriented strategy. This most notably makes passing function arguments a lot slower, although SDCC has some optimizations for this.</li></ul><h3 id="non-programming-language-option" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#non-programming-language-option"><span>Non-Programming Language option</span></a></h3><p>Using a GUI instead- If you don’t want to learn a programming language in order to make Game Boy games, then GB Studio is an option.

In ASM, this is essential; in C, this will let you understand what a given library function does. It will also let you understand what is possible on the Game Boy, and what isn&#39;t. (You can always ask, if you have doubts.)</p><p>I also recommend looking up <a href="https://gbdev.io/resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome-gbdev</a> for resources and tutorials. There are a lot of helpful articles there, as well as helper tools.</p><h2 id="asm-help" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#asm-help"><span>ASM Help</span></a></h2><ul><li><em>Modules</em><br> Separate your game into several &quot;entities&quot; that interact together. Camera, Player, NPCs, Loading zones, etc. This simplifies coding, by allowing you to reason independently on smaller units. This facilitates development and reduces the amount of bugs.</li><li><em>Document your functions</em><br> For each function, write a comment saying what it does, what memory it touches, and what registers it affects. This will avoid conflicts, and let you optimize your code by minimizing the amount of registers you save when calling a function.</li><li><em>Plan before writing</em><br> You should plan what register is going to be used for what within your functions <em>before starting to write them</em>. Your goal is to minimize the amount of register swapping. There&#39;s no general rule, so feel free to drop by and ask us, if you&#39;re in doubt.</li><li><em>RGBASM <code>-E</code> and RGBLINK <code>-n &lt;symfile&gt;</code></em><br> When you load <code>ROM.gb</code> or <code>ROM.gbc</code> in BGB, it automatically loads (if it exists) the file <code>ROM.sym</code> in the same folder as the ROM. This adds symbols to the debugger, which - believe me - helps <em>a ton</em>.</li></ul><h2 id="optimizing-for-gbdk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#optimizing-for-gbdk"><span>Optimizing For GBDK</span></a></h2><ul><li><em>Global variables</em><br> Use as many global variables as you can; the Game Boy has a lot of RAM compared to other platforms such as the NES, but is slow at using the stack. Thus, minimizing the number of local variables, especially in heavily-called functions, will reduce the time spent manipulating the stack.</li><li><em>Optimized code</em><br> Write code as efficient as possible. Sometimes there is a readability tradeoff, so I recommend you get the comment machine gun out and put some everywhere.</li><li>By default GBDK-2020 (after v4.0.1) will use the SDCC flag <code>--max-allocs-per-node 50000</code> for an increased optimization pass. You may also choose to use --opt-code-speed (optimize code generation towards fast code, possibly at the expense of codesize) or --opt-code-size (optimize code generation towards compact code, possibly at the expense of codespeed).</li><li><em>Inlining</em><br> When performance is important avoid using functions if you can inline them, which skips passing all arguments to the stack, mostly. Macros will be your friends there. If needed you can also use inline ASM.</li><li><strong>NEVER use recursive functions</strong></li><li><strong>AVOID printf</strong><br><code>printf</code> clobbers a sizeable chunk of VRAM with unnecessary text tiles. Instead, you should <code>sprintf</code> to a buffer in WRAM, then put that on the screen using a custom font.</li><li><em>Geometry funcs</em><br> Avoid the functions that draw geometry on-screen (lines, rectangles, etc.). The Game Boy isn&#39;t designed for this kind of drawing method, and you will have a hard time mixing this with, say, background art. Plus, the functions are super slow.</li><li><code>const</code> (very important!)<br> Declaring a variable that doesn&#39;t change as <code>const</code> <strong>greatly</strong> reduces the amount of ROM, RAM, and CPU used.<br> The technical reason behind that is that non-<code>const</code> values, <em>especially</em> arrays, are loaded to RAM from ROM in an <em>extremely</em> inefficient way. This takes up a LOT more ROM, and copies the value(s) to RAM when it&#39;s unneeded. (And the GB does not have enough RAM for that to be viable.)</li><li><em>Don&#39;t use MBC1</em><br> MBC1 is often assumed to be the simplest of all MBCs... but it has a quirk that adds some overhead every time ROM or SRAM bank switches are performed. MBC3 and MBC5 don&#39;t have this quirk, and don&#39;t add any complexity. Using MBC1 has no real use. (Let&#39;s not talk about MBC2, either.)</li></ul><h1 id="community-and-help" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community-and-help"><span>Community And Help</span></a></h1><p>If you want to get help from the community, go:</p><ul><li>To the historical IRC channel, #gbdev on <a href="http://efnet.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFNet</a> [if you don&#39;t have an IRC client, you can use the &quot;Webchat login&quot; box, just enter a username].</li><li>To the more recent <a href="https://gbdev.io/chat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gbdev Discord server</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020#discord-servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GBDK/ZGB</a> specific server.</li><li>And to the <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/forums" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GBDev forums</a>!</li></ul>',82)]))}const h=a(n,[["render",r]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/guides/tools.html","title":"Choosing tools for Game Boy development","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"head":[["meta",{"name":"og:title","content":"Choosing tools for Game Boy development"}],["meta",{"name":"og:description","content":"Overview of the available tools for Game Boy homebrew development."}]]},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"Assembly (ASM)","slug":"assembly-asm","link":"#assembly-asm","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"C","slug":"c","link":"#c","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Non-Programming Language option","slug":"non-programming-language-option","link":"#non-programming-language-option","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"RGBDS with ASM","slug":"rgbds-with-asm","link":"#rgbds-with-asm","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"WLA-DX with ASM","slug":"wla-dx-with-asm","link":"#wla-dx-with-asm","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"GBDK-2020 with C","slug":"gbdk-2020-with-c","link":"#gbdk-2020-with-c","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"ZGB with C & GBDK-2020","slug":"zgb-with-c-gbdk-2020","link":"#zgb-with-c-gbdk-2020","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"GB Studio","slug":"gb-studio","link":"#gb-studio","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"If you don't know ASM, C or C++","slug":"if-you-don-t-know-asm-c-or-c","link":"#if-you-don-t-know-asm-c-or-c","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"If you know C but not ASM","slug":"if-you-know-c-but-not-asm","link":"#if-you-know-c-but-not-asm","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"If you know ASM","slug":"if-you-know-asm","link":"#if-you-know-asm","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"ASM Help","slug":"asm-help","link":"#asm-help","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Optimizing For GBDK","slug":"optimizing-for-gbdk","link":"#optimizing-for-gbdk","children":[]}],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"Antonio Vivace","username":"","email":"avivace4@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"9d5609072b7135df2c1c757ab0ac8cb1b955df6e","time":1748730311000,"email":"avivace4@gmail.com","author":"Antonio Vivace","message":"gbcompo25: add jam theme"}]},"filePathRelative":"guides/tools.md"}`);export{h as comp,d as data};
