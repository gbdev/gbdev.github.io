Given that an instruction takes approximately 2 to 3 cycles, this gives the CPU a capacity of 333,000~500,000 instructions per second. Its LCD boasts 60 fps [it&#39;s actually 59.73 fps], which rounds up to between 50,000 and 80,000 instructions per frame. Suddenly not so much, eh? It also has 8 kB of RAM, and 8 kB of video RAM ; a 160x144 px LCD (thus slightly wider than it&#39;s tall), 4 colors, and 4-channel audio.</p><p>The Super Game Boy adds a few minor things, such as a customizable screen border, and some crude color. It&#39;s also slightly faster than the DMG.</p><p>The Game Boy Color <em>can</em> [if you tell it to] unlock additional functionality, such as more fleshed-out color, a double-speed CPU, twice the video RAM and <em>four times</em> the RAM!

Using <code>INT32</code>s is quite taxing on the CPU (it needs to do two consecutive 16-bit adds, and add the carry). See the tips below to avoid such blunders.</li><li>There is overhead due to C being a stack-oriented language, whereas the Game Boy&#39;s CPU is rather built for a register-oriented strategy.

Camera, Player, NPCs, Loading zones, etc. This simplifies coding, by allowing you to reason independently on smaller units. This facilitates development and reduces the amount of bugs.</li><li><em>Document your functions</em><br> For each function, write a comment saying what it does, what memory it touches, and what registers it affects. This will avoid conflicts, and let you optimize your code by minimizing the amount of registers you save when calling a function.</li><li><em>Plan before writing</em><br> You should plan what register is going to be used for what within your functions <em>before starting to write them</em>. Your goal is to minimize the amount of register swapping. There&#39;s no general rule, so feel free to drop by and ask us, if you&#39;re in doubt.</li><li><em>RGBASM <code>-E</code> and RGBLINK <code>-n &lt;symfile&gt;</code></em><br> When you load <code>ROM.gb</code> or <code>ROM.gbc</code> in BGB, it automatically loads (if it exists) the file <code>ROM.sym</code> in the same folder as the ROM.

Thus, minimizing the number of local variables, especially in heavily-called functions, will reduce the time spent manipulating the stack.</li><li><em>Optimized code</em><br> Write code as efficient as possible. Sometimes there is a readability tradeoff, so I recommend you get the comment machine gun out and put some everywhere.</li><li>By default GBDK-2020 (after v4.0.1) will use the SDCC flag <code>--max-allocs-per-node 50000</code> for an increased optimization pass. You may also choose to use --opt-code-speed (optimize code generation towards fast code, possibly at the expense of codesize) or --opt-code-size (optimize code generation towards compact code, possibly at the expense of codespeed).</li><li><em>Inlining</em><br> When performance is important avoid using functions if you can inline them, which skips passing all arguments to the stack, mostly. Macros will be your friends there. If needed you can also use inline ASM.</li><li><strong>NEVER use recursive functions</strong></li><li><strong>AVOID printf</strong><br><code>printf</code> clobbers a sizeable chunk of VRAM with unnecessary text tiles. Instead, you should <code>sprintf</code> to a buffer in WRAM, then put that on the screen using a custom font.</li><li><em>Geometry funcs</em><br> Avoid the functions that draw geometry on-screen (lines, rectangles, etc.). The Game Boy isn&#39;t designed for this kind of drawing method, and you will have a hard time mixing this with, say, background art. Plus, the functions are super slow.</li><li><code>const</code> (very important!)<br> Declaring a variable that doesn&#39;t change as <code>const</code> <strong>greatly</strong> reduces the amount of ROM, RAM, and CPU used.<br> The technical reason behind that is that non-<code>const</code> values, <em>especially</em> arrays, are loaded to RAM from ROM in an <em>extremely</em> inefficient way. This takes up a LOT more ROM, and copies the value(s) to RAM when it&#39;s unneeded. (And the GB does not have enough RAM for that to be viable.)</li><li><em>Don&#39;t use MBC1</em><br> MBC1 is often assumed to be the simplest of all MBCs... but it has a quirk that adds some overhead every time ROM or SRAM bank switches are performed. MBC3 and MBC5 don&#39;t have this quirk, and don&#39;t add any complexity. Using MBC1 has no real use.
