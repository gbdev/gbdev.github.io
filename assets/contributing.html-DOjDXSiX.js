This should include no private code. The example should be self-runnable. If a snippet is too small, create a repository.</li><li>Unless the problem is visual, do not include screenshots. They are not helpful.</li><li>Please be patient. You are probably frustrated by your problem - the maintainers are likely not aware of your workflow.</li><li>Be grateful for any help you are getting and follow through. The maintainers are likely giving you support for free.</li><li>Informal conversations are great (e.g. on Discord), but once a problem, feature request etc is outlined, opening an issue formalizing it is the most important thing you can do to help this information flow. <ul><li>Open an issue in the related repository. If you don&#39;t know where it&#39;s better suited, <a href="https://gbdev.io/chat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ask for help</a>.</li><li>Include context and any information useful to understand the situation.

Ideally a PR should address a single issue (or a set of assimilable ones).</li><li>PRs require commitment and they are an investment by the (volunteer) maintainers. If you don&#39;t have time or abandon the PR after reviews have been left and additional changes are needed, other maintainers may take over to make sure the PR can move forward and the work is not lost.</li><li>Maintainers may chime in and commit to your feature branch on minor fixes (or suggestions agreed upon).</li><li>Don&#39;t be scared of opening more PRs for the same task, if they can be logically divided. The smaller the changes, the faster they can get reviewed and eventually merged.</li><li>When adding new features, think about tests and possibly updating documentation. Think about other parts of the project which may be affected by the change.</li><li>Document trade-offs, risks, implementation and design choices, if any.</li></ul><h2 id="maintainers-workflow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#maintainers-workflow"><span>Maintainers workflow</span></a></h2><ul><li>Tests and pipelines must pass.
