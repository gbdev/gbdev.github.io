Unfortunately, it can&#39;t quite be so simple, as using <code>di</code> for this brings its own share of problems.</p><p>The most important one is that disabling the handlers like this <em>delays</em> their execution! <code>STAT</code> handlers designed to write to hardware regs during HBlank may start doing so during rendering instead; timer interrupts won&#39;t trigger as regularly now; and so on.</p><p>Using <code>di</code> is valid in some cases, but typically not when <code>STAT</code> interrupts are involved, due to their fairly strict timing requirements.</p><p>An oddly common alternative is to perform all VRAM updates in VBlank handler. (The reason why it&#39;s common especially in early GB games is likely being a carry-over from the NES, where the lack of HBlanks essentially mandates such a setup anyway.)

There are two ways to do this. One is to wait for the Drawing phase before waiting for HBlank. This effectively catches the very start of HBlank, leaving plenty of time to exit. Here&#39;s how the earlier example might look using this method:</p><div class="language-asm ext-asm line-numbers-mode"><pre class="shiki" style="background-color:#2e3440ff;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#88C0D0;">LYC</span><span style="color:#ECEFF4;">:</span><span style="color:#D8DEE9FF;">:</span></span>

Using this method, that can actually have unfortunate consequences:",-1),Ms=w(`<p>This time, when all the processing was done, there was still plenty of time left in the scanline to safely exit. However, since HBlank was so long, the routine missed the check for the drawing window and wasted an entire scanline waiting for that Drawing -&gt; HBlank transition before it exited. Not only does this waste precious CPU time, but it also limits how often raster FX can be used throughout the frame. This method still works fine though, and can be an easy approach if you use Raster FX sparingly.</p><p>I&#39;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I usually like to strive for the absolute best method. In a perfect world, we would precisely know whether we have enough HBlank left to safely exit. There actually is a way to do that though! You just need to count exactly how long your routine takes, and make sure it always exits during HBlank. This comes with some caveats though. Most routines, if they haven&#39;t been specifically designed for this method, will take a variable amount of time. The main things you need to avoid are <code>if</code> statements and loops. Specifically, if statements of this form are problematic:</p><div class="language-asm ext-asm line-numbers-mode"><pre class="shiki" style="background-color:#2e3440ff;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#D8DEE9FF;">    </span><span style="color:#616E88;">; test a condition here...</span></span>

With a 5-cycle offset due to a <code>call</code>, and the longest possible HBlank, the earliest HBlank might start is cycle 54, so that&#39;s the first attempt to read <code>STAT</code>. It keeps checking <code>STAT</code> until even in the worst-case scenario, it knows that HBlank will start. Then, it uses that time to write the scroll registers and exit. This way, it can still exit early, as long as the HBlank length permits. This routine takes 104 cycles in the worst-case scenario, but may take as few as 79 if HBlank comes sooner.</p><p>The reason that the double-busy-loop method requires checking for Mode 3 but this method does not is that the double-busy-loop method is not cycle-counted, so you might be at the very end of HBlank which is problematic. Since this method is cycle-counted, you know that if HBlank has begun, you are at or near the start of it.</p><p>If we make a similar list of pros and cons for this method, this is what it might look like:</p><h2 id="hybrid-cycle-counting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hybrid-cycle-counting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hybrid cycle-counting</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>may exit very early if HBlank is longer</li><li>allows enough time during blanking to write to up to three registers</li><li>never takes longer than one scanline</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>requires all code to be constant-time</li><li>requires tedious cycle-counting</li></ul><p>This method can work well in many circumstances, and is especially suited to frequent effects that modify multiple registers and need to exit quickly to avoid taking too much CPU time. This method can even work reasonably well when used on every scanline through the Mode 2 interrupt.</p><p>All three of these methods can generate great-looking effects, but I think the third one is an especially attractive option.</p><p>Congrats! You made it to the end of the tutorial! I bet you&#39;re tired of reading it, and I&#39;m tired of writing it too.
