This is really handy for certain kinds of games like platformers or top-down racing games (though there are LOTS of other kinds of games that benefit from this) where the view is the &#39;camera&#39; and its position is set once per frame.</p><p>When you don&#39;t require scrolling, and when your cart boots, <code>SCY</code>/<code>SCX</code> is typically set to 0,0. When a screen is displayed, it appears normally even though you only set the values once.

Well, we need to change that value <em>before</em> line 0 starts, which means it has to be done in the VBlank. And <strong>that</strong> means we need one more element. In short, we need the height of the screen plus one (144+1=145) elements in each buffer.</p><p>This tutorial is only concerned with the scroll registers, so it only needs to store 2 values per line: one for <code>SCY</code> and one for <code>SCX</code>.

It&#39;s structured in a logical way and there are comments where applicable.</p><p>The effects are called &quot;parts&quot; by the code and each part has an <code>Init</code> and <code>Process</code> routine. The sequence is controlled by a table of <code>Init</code> pointers and driven by the <code>ProcessPartTransition</code> routine. Each <code>Init</code> is responsible for setting up the data for the effect (part) and to set the <code>Process</code> function pointer via the <code>SetProcessFunc</code> macro. When the effect is done, the <code>Process</code> routine calls the <code>SetChangePartFlag</code> to tell the tutorial driver to move to the next part.</p><p>There are non-effect parts present to get the effect sequence looking good when the parts are played one after the other. These are &quot;delay&quot; parts of various flavors:</p><ul><li><code>ShowDelay</code>: this shows the screen normally for a few seconds</li><li><code>LightDelay</code>: this shows a light-colored blank screen for a few seconds</li><li><code>DarkDelay</code>: this shows a dark-colored blank screen for a few seconds</li></ul><p>The <code>Delay</code> parts share code because they&#39;re only present to make the ROM look nice, but the effects parts were developed in a way to be isolated from one another. This was done to make extraction easier. Because of this, you will see similar code present across several parts, for example, the various Sine effects.</p><p>One quirk you might notice when looking at VRAM is that the tile map is placed at 0,4 instead of 0,0. This was done to get the roll/unroll to handle the top of the screen correctly. The effects look best when they smoothly (dis)appear off-screen and if the image was placed at 0,0, the code to handle that would be distracting to how to implement the core of the effect.</p><p>Another topic worth mentioning is the row of light tiles that are under the image in VRAM. This was necessary to allow <code>LightDelay</code> to exist. Those light tiles don&#39;t <em>have</em> to be right under the image, that&#39;s just where it was placed for this tutorial. It could be moved well out of the way so it doesn&#39;t affect the effects that show that part of VRAM (Y Sine, Roll On, Roll Off).</p>',8),V={href:"https://bgb.bircd.org/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},F=t("h2",{id:"exercises-for-the-reader",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#exercises-for-the-reader","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Exercises for the reader")],-1),M={href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-GTCao5cxs",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},H={href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leTk0uRnE_g&t=91s",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},L={href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlMl8XKCb1Y&t=63s",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},D={href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvbQD2pbJes",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},I={href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kXiU_odMMM&t=110s",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},W=t("h2",{id:"prs-are-welcome",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#prs-are-welcome","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" PRs are welcome!")],-1),O=t("p",null,"Other effects can be done, such as flipping the entire image about the X axis to look like its tumbling.
